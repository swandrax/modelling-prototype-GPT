# Modelling Prototype GPT-5 (SIGMA Series)
> Developed by Swandaru Tirta Sandhika | SIGMAPrompt Contributor 

This repository contains a series of experimental modelling prototypes designed to simulate, analyze, and architect the next evolution of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), specifically aligned for GPT-5 and beyond.

## 🔬 Objective
To develop an **open prototype modelling framework** based on strategic feedback and alignment input to strengthen the future architecture, safety, and learning adaptability of LLMs (Large Language Models).
